<h1 class="page-title">A designer’s perspective on solo travel</h1>
  
   
  <div class="content--post">
    <p>Anyone who talks with me regularly will tell you that I have a strong case of wanderlust. If I haven’t traveled anywhere in a while, my conversations will usually include something along the lines of ‘Damn, I can’t wait to get out of here and go to ____’, tips on searching for cheap plane flights, or lol’ing at myself because I booked a flight without taking a second to think about it. Traveling tends to occupy a good portion of my thoughts, but I attribute it to my thirst for continually new experiences and having spent most of my college years majoring in Global Studies.</p>

<h2>Things I’ve Learned From Solo Travel</h2>

<h3>1. Trust that things will work out</h3>

<p>My most recent trip to Croatia and Slovenia involved a lot of traveling to get to my next destination. Altogether, I took five flights, one bus, two trains, and rented a car to drive about five hours. I was paranoid that every one of my travel arrangements wouldn’t work out and spent a lot of time researching on tripadvisor about other people’s experiences prior to traveling.</p>

<p><img src="https://igcdn-photos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/t51.2885-15/11055644_371692649690612_1050535963_n.jpg" alt="Dubrovnik" /></p>

<p>But the bus from Dubrovnik to Split was waiting at the bus station when I arrived, clearly marked and impossible not to spot, and left promptly with only around fifteen people occupying the coach seats.</p>

<p>The car rental agency didn’t even ask any questions when I offered up a debit card instead of credit. I didn’t even have to turn on the GPS to find my way out of the city onto the main highway because the signage was so clear and hard not to miss.</p>

<p>When I purchased my train ticket an hour before I was leaving Zagreb, the attendant spoke very little English, but I was able to communicate a round-trip ticket to Ljubljana. Even though I probably had a very confused look on my face when she handed me a ticket with handwritten destinations, I was able to get from Zagreb to Ljubljana and back painlessly (even with border control).</p>

<p><img src="https://igcdn-photos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/t51.2885-15/11015602_1617397625160658_187306894_n.jpg" alt="Border Control between Croatia and Slovenia" /></p>

<p>When you’re traveling alone, there’s no one there to ask dumb questions to reassure yourself that everything’s going to work out just fine. But it’s not worth the extra pain involved in worrying if you got the right address, or if you communicated the right thing, or if the train you’re about to get on is actually going to the city you want (tip: just check the time, trains are pretty punctual). Things will work out more often than not, and if it doesn’t, hey, it’s an adventure.</p>

<p>When I’m designing, especially in UX, there’s usually a need to thoroughly research everything and while this is great for figuring out if users know where to click or if you’re really off from your target goal, most of the time there’s more than one solution. The amount of time spent researching might reveal that one solution is a little bit better than another, but is it worth the time spent researching beforehand or would it have just been better to launch and tweek later? (I lean more towards the latter.)</p>

<h3>2. Learn to let go a bit of control</h3>

<p>Along those lines, it’s really easy to want to know all the details of something before getting into a project or going on a trip. Quite a few years ago, I used to have so much anxiety about going anywhere new that I’d make sure to look on a map beforehand. And then google street view the shit out of it. And double check transit times. And nervously play with my hair for an hour before convincing myself out of going.</p>

<p>Same thing goes for doing days worth of design research on something I should’ve just jumped into and kicked around. Having a little bit of research to nudge a designer along in a certain direction is great, but it’s much better to just jump into something and figure out the right solution than spend time researching what the right solution may be. Because no one else has solved your problem yet.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the trip, I started to let go of looking into every detail to make myself more comfortable with where I was going, how I was getting there, and what I was doing. I forgot to take screenshots of maps to places I was staying and instead relied on my general sense of direction, people (actual real people!), and wayfinding. These days, it’s more commonplace to turn first to the internet to look something up or ask a question when it’s probably quicker just asking in person. It’s ok to feel a little lost, but trust that you’ll find where you need to be.</p>

<h3>3. Be friendly and say hi to just about everyone</h3>

<p>Seriously. We could all just a bit more of this in our everyday lives. Think of your best friend and all the amazing things you’ve done together. Now just imagine all the people you encounter that you could potentially have similar experiences with. Once you start treating everyone as a potential friend and are open, traveling alone doesn’t seem so lonely.</p>

<p><img src="https://igcdn-photos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/t51.2885-15/1538412_938577112829495_280045765_n.jpg" alt="Ljubljana" /></p>

<p>I met some great, friendly people throughout my trip who were able to show my around their city and give me an experience I probably wouldn’t have been able to have on my own.</p>

<p>But don’t stop there.</p>

<p>It’s really easy to get sucked back into the old ways of being so closed off in DC. Traveling alone helps me break free of that, speak my mind and realize I have a ton of interests other than just work and traveling. Every time I travel, I always try to bring a little bit more friendliness and openness back with me.</p>

<p>One caveat though, always be a little bit cautious and make sure you’re staying safe. Just because you’re traveling to a different city doesn’t mean you can just go wild. The same sort of city rules apply.</p>

<h3>4. Learn to just be</h3>

<p>Be alone. Be present. Be an actual human being instead of a robot tied to a phone.</p>

<p>My first night in Dubrovnik went something a little like this:
Holy crap this is an awesome place to stay, hell yes bathrobes. <em>Pats self on back and gets ready for bed.</em> Now just to plug in my phon— Well, damn. Forgot my adapter.</p>

<p>For the first half of the trip, I went without a phone charger, so I HAD to reserved the battery for picture-taking instead of wasting it all on twitter, meerkat, or whatever everyone was into during that time.</p>

<p><img src="https://igcdn-photos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/t51.2885-15/10808621_486050114876248_1907485950_n.jpg" alt="Plitvice National Park" /></p>

<p>This has also been the second solo trip I decided not to get a sim card for my phone in order to use it on local cell networks. That meant no google maps, foursquare, etc. outside of any wifi networks. The longer I stopped looking at my phone, the less I kept reaching for it, instead just taking in the sights for as long as I wanted.</p>

<p>Not being surrounded by friends, in real life or virtually, most of the time also meant a lot of alone time. Just me. Chilling with my thoughts about life and things. I finished the one book I brought three days into my trip and spent most of my four hour bus ride from Dubrovnik to Split staring out the window at the gorgeous coastline and riveria. Not for one second would I have traded that for seeing someone’s tweet or reading a book.</p>
