<p>Howdy! I'm Klare Frank, a self-taught designer and frontend developer based in Washington, DC. Currently, I'm a designer on the team at <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> and am thrilled to be helping people learn the skills to build amazing things. I've also taught frontend development at <a href="http://generalassemb.ly">General Assembly</a> and have spoken at conferences including <a href="http://contrarycon.com">ContraryCon</a> and <a href="http://codeherconference.com/">Code(Her)</a>. When I'm not at a computer, I enjoy crafting up new homebrew recipes, spending a hell of a lot of time in secondhand bookstores looking for the next book to read, taking my mid-90s carbon fiber Trek out for a ride around the city, catching so many shows at the 930 club, or enjoying an old fashioned at my favorite bar.</p> 

<p>You can find me on <a href="http://twitter.com/klare">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://dribbble.com/klare">Dribbble</a> or around DC at events like <a href="https://twitter.com/refreshdc">Refresh DC</a>, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/dcnightowls/">DC Nightowls</a>, or <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-DC/">Women Who Code DC</a>.<p>
<p>This site was built using Jekyll and is hosted on <a href="http://github.com/kfrank/kfrank.github.io">Github</a>.</p>
