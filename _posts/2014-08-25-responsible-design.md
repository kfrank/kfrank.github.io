## Making deliberate choices

It's time we take a hard look at the types of projects we’re designing and ask ourselves is this providing significant good?.

Throughout my career, I’ve only once been placed in a situation where I’ve had to ask myself how my designs were helping the motives of an organization I didn’t agree with. It ended up affecting the choices I made in how I designed and I was deliberately questioning the design decisions I was making not in a ‘will this layout be easier to read and digest’ sort of way, but a ‘is this design too good that it’ll give more power to an organization I stand against?’.

It was the first time in three years of designing that I had ever had to ask myself that question. Growing a career in Washington, DC can be quite polarizing, but I had somehow managed to stay on the do-gooders side, working with nonprofits that were community assets, government projects creating tools for financial education, and startups with ideas to benefit society. Yet, there’s another side of DC I’m sure most of our country sees much more of portrayed in the news media in forms of scandals and questionable lobbying practices.

Thankfully, we fired the client a week later, and at our year end recap, a coworker said she’d never been happier not to see a million dollars. I wholeheartedly agree.

My client wasn’t killing people, and they didn’t create products that were questionable, but they did stand for something I’m against. If you’re designing for an organization who’s mission you hate, how can you really ever love the work you do?

From one brief experience, I’ve learned moral responsibility is as much of a question, if not more, as all the ux decisions. The things we choose to create end up not only defining us but shaping the world around us.
