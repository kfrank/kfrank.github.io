It’s the same question that comes up during every interview: “If you could choose between only designing and only coding, which would it be?” The first time that question came up, it caught me off guard, mostly because I hadn’t experienced one separate from the other.

To a young and naive me, coding was what my Dad did in his home office with five terminal windows open. It reminded me of when he worked in an actual office and there was a warm, humming server room with wires everywhere. It was a mystical place where I didn’t know what those big, tall racks did, or how someone could manipulate real, physical things to make connected systems work. I definitely didn't do that.

Design was something that people usually graduated from school from where they put together their final book project and gushed over typefaces. I still can’t call line-height leading when I’m not looking at type on a screen. Fonts specifically designed for screens were barely available when I was first looking for a job and while I knew what proper spacing was and could call myself a designer, I definitely knew nothing about print. I didn’t have a degree in it (which fueled my imposter syndrome for years following).

Early on, even before I knew that graduating with a degree in Global Studies was pointless and I’d get nothing more than having a comprehensive understanding of countries on a map and a dust-collecting diploma, my idols were the ones creating the web. They were the ones pushing for better type rendering on screens, responsive design, more whitespace, easier organization of frontend code, and simplifying web experiences. In my mind, these were all the same people and if I was ever going to be a great designer who also influenced the future of the web, I needed to be doing all of these things.

So when the question was posed to me, I said neither. Without one or the other, I would easily become bored and uninterested, probably lamenting the loss of using skills I enjoyed using every day.

However, Visual design has consistently been the most challenging aspect of design. It's taken a while to get to a point where I could illustrate anything I thought was of decent quality. I’ve nearly cried over designs that weren’t coming together and sometimes wished I would've had an education from a design school because maybe it would've made things easier. But I’ve always stuck with it and pushed through the muck to chisel out something I can be somewhat proud of.

##A Fork in the Road
As I’m in the midst of transitioning jobs, I’ve dwelled upon the few pivotal opportunities where I could've chosen to do only user experience design. It would’ve set me down a track based solely on facts, research, and testing. And while those are all necessary parts of design, I never did choose that path.

> Choosing to specialize and be a user experience designer simply felt like giving up.

Even when I was placed on teams and titled the ‘visual designer’ and paired with user experience designers and frontend developers, I tried to never be complacent in my role, always chosing constant collaboration over strict role delegation.

In order to be the best designer I can, it takes a strong understanding of how the web works, the trends (good or bad), and the best practices.

Siloing is for suckers.

##A Visual Designer is a UX Designer is a Designer
Any good visual designer needs to also know user experience design. User experience design doesn’t stop at gray boxes; it extends to how a user responds to a page, and that includes how it looks as well as how it functions. It’s more than making a site ‘look pretty’ or coloring in boxes. It means no less research, user testing or analytical thought.

Mark Boulton describes this perfectly in his article [Visual Design is Not a Thing](https://themanual.org/read/issues/2/mark-boulton/article). In it, he describes the industry's response to Jesse James Garrett’s *The Elements of User Experience*: 

*“This attitude was unfortunately reinforced by the recent rise in the opinion that user experience design—not graphic design—was the definition of good web design. … According to the industry’s perception of this model, what designers don’t do on the surface plane is design; they decorate.”*

This attitude is reflected in the salary difference between [ux designers](http://www.coroflot.com/designsalaryguide/user-experience-designer/united-states) and [web designers](http://www.coroflot.com/designsalaryguide/web-designer/united-states). UX designers are consistently paid more even though visual designers have all the skills they need to know how to be a compentent ux designer on top of what they already practice.


*“Visual Design is still the most important pillar which supports the UX (don’t forget the the “X” stands for “Experience”) framework, and most users still evaluate the credibility of a website based solely on it’s visual appeal.”*
