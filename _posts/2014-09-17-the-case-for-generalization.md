It's safe to say I had little clue what I was doing in my first job out of college (who does?). Hired because I happened to use the creative director's favorite font at the time on my resume, looked somewhat like the designer I was replacing, and (more importantly) knew how to write html and css, I was titled 'UI Designer'. The majority of my job consisted of receiving wireframes from our Information Architect and adding style as a layer on top of them. 

I was a decorator.

The only times I ever thought about what we traditionally refer to as user experience were the few project that were brochure websites. Four years ago, they were still never wider than 960 pixels and the client definitely wanted to have everything on the homepage sit 'above the fold'. Thinking about user experience on these types of sites affected more or less only navigation structure and how to order a carousel. I was naive calling myself a 'designer', and having no formal design education fueled my imposter syndrome for years following. Yet, knowing I was capable of greater critical thought (hey, I didn't pay over $130,000 for a liberal arts degree for nothing, right?), I moved on to positions that would let me do just that.

We're often told that designers are problem solvers. We like to ask 'what if?'. We like to observe. When my grandmother is using her computer asking "Am I doing this right?", I'm more likely to think someone did a poor job designing than tell her she's doing it wrong.
