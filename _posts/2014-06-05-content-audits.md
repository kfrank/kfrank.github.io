You just can't know what you're transforming until you understand what you've got. Doing a content audit isn't a step of a redesign that shouldn't be skipped since necessary information can be drawn from what we've been creating since the last web redesign.

##Duplicate information
This ones pretty straightforward. We found several instances of pages created for the intention of redirects. Also, several blog posts had been created as project recaps when they really should've been work case studies.

##Pages that were created as a solution that other parts if the site weren't solving (but could've).
As mentioned above, project recap posts would be created in addition to work pages. Since our work section couldn't accommodate an explanation of our process, or more than a couple of paragraphs and a dozen images, blog posts were used to supplement. On our new site, we're planning on doing only case studies for all new work, solving the disconnect between work and blog posts.

Another outlier was the link to the case study deck underneath work. I flagged that as another place where new pages were being adapted to suit needs instead of the site working for us.

##Understanding the breadth of existing content
I had initially thought our site would have a lot of hidden and superfluous pages, but it ended up being fairly straightforward. Our biggest content, not surprisingly, came from blog posts and work, closely followed by team bios, author pages and categories. Our blog is a HUGE deal. Just imagine if all the teams wrote regularly, and not just strategy & clever girl.

##Content in wrong areas
As mentioned before, our work content also existed on our blog, along with a huge amount of physical experiments that could've been more highlighted.

##Discovering the 'heart' of a website. (If you removed this section, could the site still exist and make sense?)
