## The Problem

Earning a living as a professional tennis coach can be difficult at times because of the complexities of scheduling between coach, player, and court. 

## What We Built

CourtPlay is an effort to make booking a tennis lesson effortless. A coach can manage their schedule, message players and receive payments via the web app. A player can search for coaches in their area, book lessons directly with them and pay them online.

## What I Worked On
