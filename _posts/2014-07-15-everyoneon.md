intro: "A website redesign that combines the old everyoneon.org and connect2compete.org. EveryoneOn aims to bridge the digital divide by providing affordable internet access. Our targeted audiences were K-12 families, seniors, and job-seekers, providing a difficult challenge for a wide range of age groups, backgrounds, and goals."

## The Problem

Originally the Connect2Compete program, EveryoneOn came to iStrategyLabs to combine the two brands under one redesigned website. With a focus on information architecture and design, ISL worked with the EveryoneOn team to reorganize content and present it in a simple, digestible, mobile-friendly format.

## What We Built

Myself and the team at iStrategyLabs built a complete website that combined two previous websites and brands (Connect2Compete and EveryoneOn). This was especially challenging considering the wide range of audiences (children and families, job-seekers, and seniors). With a focus on information architecture and design, we worked with the EveryoneOn team to reorganize content and present it in a simple, digestible, mobile-friendly format.

## What I Worked On

I was responsible for guiding the client through both visual design and user experience design.

### Sitemap

As mentioned, we were combining two websites together, which involved a comphrensive look at the content.

### Wireframes

This was my first experience in deliberately choosing to do in-browser wireframes. I wanted the client and our entire team to see how the website might feel with actual content at different screen sizes.

I also provided an annotated version of the wireframes. This allowed me to tie certain sections directly to our audience and goals.

### Visual Design

#### Typography
I wanted to choose a typefaces that were friendly and approachable to help the website seem more inviting to our wide range of audiences.

#####Adelle
Chosen because of it's personality and flexibility that, when paired with a softer typeface, adds an element of authority. In the context of this website, it was used exclusively for headlines.

#####Proxima Nova Soft
A more approachable rounded version of Proxima Nova. I almost always chose to pair this with Adelle to soften the slab serif.

#####Effra
A sans-serif known for it's clean lines and open proportions that create a geometric and modern typeface.

#### Color
EveryoneOn already had a color palette of red and blue. I choose to tweak the colors slightly so that they were less harsh and more youthful while adding a darker blue to balance out whitespace.
