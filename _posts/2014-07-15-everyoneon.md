<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>Originally the Connect2Compete program, EveryoneOn came to iStrategyLabs to combine the two brands under one redesigned website. With a focus on information architecture and design, ISL worked with the EveryoneOn team to reorganize content and present it in a simple, digestible, mobile-friendly format.</p>

<p>The team at iStrategyLabs and I built a complete website that combined two previous websites and brands (Connect2Compete and EveryoneOn). This was especially challenging considering the wide range of audiences (children and families, job-seekers, and seniors). With a focus on information architecture and design, we worked with the EveryoneOn team to reorganize content and present it in a simple, digestible, mobile-friendly format.</p>

<h2>Information Architecture</h2>

<p>As mentioned, we were combining two websites together, which involved a comprehensive look at the content.</p>

<h3>What we started with</h3>

<h2>Wireframes</h2>

<p>This was my first experience in deliberately choosing to do in-browser wireframes. I wanted the client and our entire team to see how the website might feel with actual content at different screen sizes.</p>

<p>I also provided an annotated version of the wireframes. This allowed me to tie certain sections directly to our audience and goals.</p>

<h2>Visual Design</h2>

<h3>Typography</h3>
<p>I wanted to choose a typefaces that were friendly and approachable to help the website seem more inviting to our wide range of audiences.</p>
</div>

![Type]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/everyoneon/type.jpg)

<div class="content--post">
<h4>Adelle</h4>
<p>Chosen because of it's personality and flexibility that, when paired with a softer typeface, adds an element of authority. In the context of this website, it was used exclusively for headlines.</p>

<h4>Proxima Nova Soft</h4>
<p>A more approachable rounded version of Proxima Nova. I almost always chose to pair this with Adelle to soften the slab serif.</p>

<h4>Effra</h4>
<p>A sans-serif known for it's clean lines and open proportions that create a geometric and modern typeface.</p>
</div>

<div class="content--post">
<h3>Color</h3>
<p>EveryoneOn already had a color palette of red and blue. I choose to tweak the colors slightly so that they were less harsh and more youthful while adding a darker blue to balance out whitespace.</p>
