<h2>What We Built</h2>
<p>We put together a full experience, including a social media campaign, website and app design, and a promo video to ensure the prank was fully believable. Users arrived at a striking single-page website (that purposefully mimicked the style of trendy startup websites) to view the full offering of the BeardSwipe app. The site drove users to a marketing video, featuring many of our bearded and not-so-bearded team members. When users clicked the 'Download The App' button they were taken to the iStrategyLabs website and informed that they had been pranked.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting aspects of our team composition was that work was self-assigned. No one team member was told what they should work on or what process to use in approaching their responsibilities. From kickoff to launch, the entire project was created in a sum of two weeks.</p>

<h2>What I Worked on</h2>
<p>I choose to tackle both design and development of the product website. Knowing that it was to be released as an April Fools joke, I wanted the visual design to mock recent trends while still keeping a streamlined user experience that supported the campaign.</p>

<h3>Wireframes</h3>
<p>Working to get in code as soon as possible, I did a quick mockup of interactions with notes on functionality I needed to tackle straight away in code. I handed these to my copywriter who delved into creating some of the snarky commentary.</p>

<h3>Art Direction</h3>

<p>We wanted the website to appeal to what we liked to call the 'urban woodsman', a special breed of bearded man who owned both an axe and a fixed gear bicycle. To reflect this, I chose to use the gold iphone in the designs and pulled out some of that gold to use as accents.</p>

<p>I also wanted the visual design to be a nod to startup website design trends common around April 2014, as a slight mockery since the product was actually fake. This is why I choose Brandon Grotesque and Helvetica Neue as my base fonts.</p>
