<i>I see a lot of my peers in situations that lead them to long hours at work, working on weekends, and taking naps at work. At some companies, this behavior is encouraged and seen as a sign of dedication. At others ([such as I the one I work at](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/at-some-start-ups-fridays-are-so-casual-everyone-can-stay-home/2015/02/06/31e8407e-9d1c-11e4-96cc-e858eba91ced_story.html)), time outside of work is valued to prevent burnout and promote smarter work. </i>

<i>My mother, Louisa Frank, taught herself how to program in the early ‘80s and has been an inspiration for me working in technology. She later moved into a leadership role in the technology department at a large bank, managing a whole team of project managers and developers. Even though we’re a generation apart and she was in the banking industry, not a startup culture, I can see a lot of parallels between our experiences, especially when it comes to companies promoting a culture of being always available for work.</i>

<i>Her takeaway? It’s the experiences and people that matter. You’re probably not going to remember that deadline you may have missed by an hour if you had’t stayed up late, but you will remember a missed opportunity to spend with family or friends.</i>

<i>Spread the love where it counts.</i>

Some of us are aware that there is nothing more important than family, but many people cannot balance their home life and work life appropriately. Not everyone knows that home is as important, if not more, than work. I heard, once, that you should think about what you want written on your tombstone when you die. Will it say that you lived your life loving your family or that you lived your life at work, hardly ever seeing your family? Balance is important. I’ve seen more than one marriage fall apart because the individual cannot maintain a good balance in and out of the office.

I was lucky. I have a very understanding spouse and kids that are proud of me and support me, as well. Not everyone is so blessed. However, even with a supportive family, I had to work hard at a balance between work and home. Did I achieve it? I’ll be the first to admit that I didn’t, but I wasn’t too far off balance, even with the long hours I put in at the office. There are a few times that I regretted not being able to drop everything and rush home, but it worked out, in the end.

When I hired people, I told them, up front, that everyone often had to work overtime to support technical issues, bring in a project on time, or complete new installations and updates. Most times overtime could be planned ahead. For instance, if we were doing an install of new software, we would know this ahead of time and be able to predict when we’d be spending more hours at work than at home. What couldn’t be accounted for were those emergencies that popped up, and they were numerous, and they sucked at our personal time like a vampire sucks blood from his victim.

As a manager, it is important to be aware of how much time your people spend at work, or working. It is so simple to become burned out by working too much, and so easy to see family life fall apart. Everyone is different in how much balance they need, but it is not only up to you, as an individual, to ensure you are getting it, but up to you, as a manager, to be aware if your people are balancing properly. Balance keeps everyone happy, and in top mental shape to perform at work. Happy people help projects come in on time and budget.

As a woman, with children, I think I was able to sympathize with many of my people when they needed time at home. I also think I had more awareness of the balance between work and family, not only for my own situation, but for my people, too.

In order to balance my work and home life, I often planned vacations away, with my husband and kids. That’s something I enjoyed, but we also spent quality time at home playing games, swimming, cooking, watching television, and other things. I remember well standing, soaking wet in my swim suit, on the phone at a Disney water park, and sitting on a bench outside of the Haunted Mansion, again, on the phone. I was contacted to get on production support issues. While my husband and the kids had a blast, I put in my time on the phone helping get the issue fixed.

Why not make it a rule to never contact people while on vacation? I thought of that rule. For my own team, when one of my developers went on vacation, I made sure he left his pager (yeah, we had pagers back then) at the office. If it was a dire emergency, I knew how to get in touch with him, but otherwise, no one else was allowed to bother him, or her, while they were away. Now-a-days, everyone has a mobile phone, so it is easy to contact someone. Texting is a way of life. If I were out in the workforce, now, I’d tell my people to ignore all calls/texts from anyone except me.

Having that precious, uninterrupted time spent with your spouse, friend, or family is important for that balance. Not getting it can quickly lead to burnout. Does it hurt not to be able to contact the one person that might get the issue solved quickly? You bet! But in the long run, it makes others more self-sufficient, forcing them to learn the software and how to fix it, and it helped me to learn, as a manager, the capabilities of my people.

Another time, I was on a call, on and off, throughout the night and into the morning. I was behind closed doors in my home office, but I had the phone on speaker with the volume low so as not to disturb anyone else. My parents were, at the time, temporarily living in my basement, having decided to move back near their children and grandchildren after retirement. I thought everyone was asleep. Imagine my surprise when my father strode into my office, wearing only his underwear. He stomped right up to my desk and stood over the phone and said something like, 

“You quit that damn job!”

He then calmly left the room. Since I was on speaker, everyone on the call heard him. There was silence on the other end of the line. No one spoke for almost a whole minute then someone, I don’t know who, diffused the situation by saying something funny, but I could tell everyone on the call was thinking the same thing as me: “What the heck am I doing?” It made me review my work/home balance to make sure I wasn’t going overboard. I stepped back a bit, after that incident.

I said I had an understanding spouse and kids that supported me. Really, though, my kids knew my office at work inside and out because they spent a lot of time there. Often, on the weekends, they went in to the office with me. It was their home away from home. They knew the vending machine selections by heart. It also gave them time to get to know my developers and my bosses and it gave me time with the kids, even though I was working. My developer’s kids spent time in the office, too, so it was not uncommon. I remember someone’s kid riding their tricycle around and around the office cubes while we worked.

(Those connections that my kids made when they were young, visiting my office were put to use later on to their benefit. My son scored a summer job when he was in college, working with another team at my company, which lead, eventually, to a full time job in the technology world when he finished college. My daughter used her work connections to get a recommendation from one of my very senior bosses to the college of her choice. She met that super senior boss at a wedding we were invited to when she was younger, and, when it came time to apply to colleges, he remembered her.)

Did I quit that damn job? In actuality, I quit five times over the thirteen years I worked there, but every time I quit, someone talked me out of it. When I quit for the final time, number six, it was for real. At that time, the company had totally changed. If it hadn’t, I’d probably still be there. I have never regretted that final decision.

Maybe I should have quit that job sooner. I ended up making a lot of money, enough to take the whole family wherever we wanted on vacation each year. We didn’t want for lack of funds. That was for sure, and I got to treat my family to all sorts of new adventures that I wouldn’t want to trade for anything, but was it worth it to have to spend all that time away from them? I’ll never know. I’m still married, and my kids have grown and started their own careers, and I have regrets that I didn’t spend enough time with them, but I think I did the best I could in balancing my career and my home life. It was important to me back then, and it is still important to me. It should be important to everyone.

OK. So what am I getting at? Do you need to spend hours and hours at work to get ahead? No. You need to create a good balance between your work life and your home life so that you are satisfied you are doing the best you can with both. You must also use your after hours work time wisely and get the most out of it. Be aware of your balance and work at keeping it healthy.

I learned many lessons in my long career in technology, climbing the ladder rung by rung to the executive level. I used those lessons wisely, and, even today, still use them. I also include them in all my books. They are still relevant, no matter what the job. I’ve changed careers from being a technology executive to working at becoming a writer, yet my past lessons still come into play for me. Even though I’m older and there’s a new generation out there in the working world, it’s surprising how so much changes, but so much stays the same.
