intro: "Build and refine homebrewing recipes while keeping track of current brews. The app aims to sit at the center of homebrewing complexity, with just enough for brewers to feel like mad scientists without taking the fun out of drinking beers all day while watching a pot boil."

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>One Two Brew is a side project I started developing about six months after I first started homebrewing. I quickly found the barrier to entry in the hobby was uniquely high, but I enjoyed the level of complexity found in the math and science of homebrewing.</p> 

<p>What I found to be lacking was a good way of tracking brews and being reminded of benchmarks in the brewing process. There were already a few tools existing that helped with robust recipe creation, but none of them went a step further and gave the brewer unique timers associated with their recipes. From the very beginning, I decided this would be a phone app, since going back to look at a computer was simply not as convenient when brewing as pulling out a phone with one hand.</p>

<h2>What I Worked On</h2>

<h3>Userflows</h3>
<p>Since I knew this was going to be a complex app, I decided to break the user flow into two parts: recipe creation, and brewing timers.</p>

<h3>Wireframes</h3>
<p>I went through several iterations of wireframes trying to find the best ways of showing time elapses and user inputed data for recipes. What I arrived on was a vertical timer (instead of a circular one) and a radar graph for viewing and editing recipe stats.</p>
