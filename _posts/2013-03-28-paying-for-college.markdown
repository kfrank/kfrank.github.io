## The Problem

Student debt can be a confusing arena where it's often difficult to understand how to compare the financial benefits of getting a college degree. Getting a college degree is often a part of the American dream, but students and parents taking on this debt often fail to realize the debt burden after school.

## What We Built

As a part of the products team at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB, I primarily worked as a visual designer, prototyping my ideas in code and working with other ux designers in sprint cycles to release Paying for College, a set of tools catered towards the education life milestone. 

## What I Worked On

### UX

[Brittany Mederos](http://brouin.com) and I collaborated on how to build this tool, whiteboarding out different scenarios that we'd both elaborate on and test. We ran into issues of how users were going to input data (if at all), how we would integrate two-year and four-year programs, and how to easily compare costs of different programs.

### Interface Design
