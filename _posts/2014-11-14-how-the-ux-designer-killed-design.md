It’s the same question that comes up during every interview: “If you could choose between only designing and only coding, which would it be?” The first time I was asked that, it caught me off guard, mostly because I hadn’t experienced one separate from the other.

To a young and naive me, coding was what my Dad did in his home office with five terminal windows open. It reminded me of when he worked in an actual office and there was a warm, humming server room with wires everywhere making tangled nests behind the server racks. It was a mystical place where I didn’t know what those big, tall racks did, or how someone could manipulate real, physical things to make connected systems work. I definitely didn’t do that.

Design was something that people graduated from school with a degree in where they put together their final book project and gushed over typefaces. Fonts designed for screens were barely available when I was first looking for a job and while I knew what proper spacing was and could call myself a designer, I definitely knew nothing about print. I didn’t have a degree in it. That single, lacking, piece of paper fueled my imposter syndrome for years following. I still can’t call line-height leading when I’m not looking at type on a screen.

Early on, even before I knew that graduating with a degree in Global Studies would yield nothing more than having a comprehensive understanding of countries on a map, my idols were the ones creating the web. They were the ones pushing for better type rendering on screens, responsive design, more whitespace, easier organization of frontend code, and simplifying web experiences. In my mind, these were all the same people and if I was ever going to be a great designer who also influenced the future of the web, I needed to be doing all these things.

So when the question was posed to me, I said neither. Without one or the other, I would easily become bored and uninterested, probably lamenting the loss of using skills I enjoyed using every day. Being a designer who practiced neither user experience design nor frontend development meant I was potentially crippling myself from being a master in the craft.

Despite that, visual design has consistently been my most challenging aspect of design. It’s taken a while to get to a point where I could illustrate anything I thought was of decent quality. I’ve nearly (and probably) cried over designs that weren’t coming together and sometimes wished I would’ve had an education from a design school because maybe it would’ve made things easier. Yet, I’ve always stuck with it and pushed through the muck to chisel out something I can be somewhat proud of.

##A Fork in the Road
As I’m in the midst of transitioning jobs, I’ve been dwelling upon the few pivotal opportunities where I could’ve chosen to do only user experience design. It would’ve set me down a track based solely on facts, research, and testing. And while those are all necessary parts of design, I never did choose that path.

> Choosing to specialize and be a user experience designer simply felt like giving up.

Even when I was placed on teams and titled the ‘visual designer’ and paired with user experience designers and frontend developers, I tried to never be complacent in my role, always choosing constant collaboration over strict role delegation. 

And maybe that’s because I’ve always felt a visual designer is more than colors and type and spacing and how things *feel*. It’s a balance of the analytic and the aesthetic. To be the best designer I can, it takes a strong understanding of how the web works, the trends (good or bad), and the best practices.

Siloing is for suckers.

##A Visual Designer is a UX Designer is a Designer
User experience design doesn’t stop at gray boxes; it extends to how a user responds to a page, and that includes how it looks as well as how it functions. It’s more than making a site ‘look pretty’ or coloring in boxes.

That’s one of the reasons the chart from [uxisnotui.com](http://www.uxisnotui.com/downloads/without-title.png) became so popular. While it’s important to help people understand all the different aspects that make up creating a user experience, somehow the column titled “How UX Wants to be Seen” got replaced with “UX Designers” and the column “How UX is Typically Seen” replaced with “Visual Designers”, making it more of a role delegation than a comprehensive list of all the things designers do.

Mark Boulton describes this perfectly in his article [Visual Design is Not a Thing](https://themanual.org/read/issues/2/mark-boulton/article). In it, he talks about the industry’s response to Jesse James Garrett’s *The Elements of User Experience*: 

*“This attitude was unfortunately reinforced by the recent rise in the opinion that user experience design—not graphic design—was the definition of good web design. … According to the industry’s perception of this model, what designers don’t do on the surface plane is design; they decorate.”*

Somewhere along the way, the collective makers of the web realized the importance of ux (yay!) while neglected advocating for visual design—the cast aside casualty. Instead of judging the quality of a website as a whole, user experience design became the most important factor. Yet, a users judge of a website’s credibility does not stop before visual design. If a website has a great experience and still looks horrible, users will still be confused. Prentice Mathew [observed this](https://medium.com/@prenticemathew/ux-specialists-are-killing-web-design-50b7d7607c13) when Gov.uk won the [“Design of the year award”](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22164715):

*“Visual Design is still the most important pillar which supports the UX (don’t forget the “X” stands for “Experience”) framework, and most users still evaluate the credibility of a website based solely on it’s visual appeal.”*

This attitude is further reflected in the salary difference between [ux designers](http://www.coroflot.com/designsalaryguide/user-experience-designer/united-states) and [web designers](http://www.coroflot.com/designsalaryguide/web-designer/united-states). UX designers are consistently paid more even though visual designers have all the skills they need to know how to be a competent ux designer on top of what they already practice. The placement of a button drives engagement while the overall style affects credibility. The choice of fonts influences the users’ disposition. A lawyer’s website set in comic sans will always prove too unprofessional and negatively accept business.

User experience processes—such as user testing, research, and creating personas— reinforce (or weaken) these assumptions made in visual design.

##An Even More Collaborative Web
It’s clear we can’t neglect visual design. But we also can’t neglect visual designers. A visual or graphic designer who expands her or his understanding of user experience design best practices and process becomes a better designer overall.
A user experience designer who learns about graphic design can better understand how design on the surface influences users. Only when both kinds of designers broaden their knowledge can they collaborate as equals and the unknown seems less mystical and scary.

Whether a team is made up of designers and developers in traditional roles or not, user experience design should not just be for ux designers. It should bear equal weight with all of the other roles and processes that make up creating web experiences. A great website comes from a collaborative environment where all disciplines of web creation are treated as equals.

For me, that means seeking out and pushing for roles that will let me practice ux and visual design while also doing frontend development. For a team, it means collaborating equally between teammates, regardless of who is working on what. 

We’re all working towards the same goal and great ideas can come from anywhere.
