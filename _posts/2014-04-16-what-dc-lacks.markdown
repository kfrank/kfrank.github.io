I couldn't really put my finger on it until I left DC.

Everyone talks about how transient this city is. I've been victim to this common thread, having two of my best friends move to different cities in the past few months. I'm happy for them to start a new adventure and gather new perspectives and experiences they weren't getting from living in DC. But eventually, most everyone packs up for somewhere new.

The second thing everyone talks about is the two same question you get asked when you meet someone new. I've heard these questions differ from city to city, but it's become such of a commonality that folks expect it when you first meet. 

##What do you do?
I usually tell people I'm a web designer and wait for the confused faces or the polarized comments about my CEO. It's a fun game when they're expecting me to ask them same question and I never do.

People usually say it's because you get judged immediately on your worth on the career climbing totem pole. I have another theory. On the surface, we're judged on the things we do, not our character. Bring up any okcupid profile and it'll list a passion for running, cooking, and traveling. You get points for being more interesting and unexpected in the things you do. Since a job makes up the majority of what a person does from day to do, it gets added to those points. It's only natural when talking about the things you do to mention (besides sleep) the thing you do the majority of the day: your job.

>In France, I've heard, it's rude to ask people what they do.

How much of DC's culture has permiated down into my core, making it impossible for me to divorce my career from my personality?

##Where are you from?
Where I usually wait for the comments on Delaware beaches or something about incorporating in Wilmington.
