Last night I taught my first class at General Assembly on the basics of HTML. Not only was it the first class of the course, but it was my first class ever. For the better part of three months I've been dealing with impostor syndrome because I'm teaching a frontend development course. As a designer. I'd nervously laugh as I told people I'd be sitting on a panel about the 'Day in the Life of a Frontend Developer' when that wasn't my job title at all, and they'd look at me like I was crazy for even thinking I *wasn't* capable of being on that panel.

When it got time to actually teach, I wasn't nervous about being discovered as a fraud. They wouldn't have hired me if they didn't think I wasn't capable of teaching the materials. Obviously. Instead, I was more nervous about not remembering everyone's name and properly communicating the concepts to all my students.

Learning how to code was mostly a solitary pursuit for me. My parents tried to get my brother to learn how to program on the old Apple 2 Plus that used to sit in our office behind the Compaq loaded up with Windows 95, but I was never encouraged as much to learn. It wasn't until middle school, when I started surfing the net that I wondered how people made websites and started researching as much as I could.

Yet, while most developers google and sit in their own little bubbles most of the time, sometimes it's just easier to ask someone more experiences.

I never really got javascript until I had a mentor and we built a webapp using knockout.js. It's funny when you take on something you think you're not capable of and things just click.

Now, being on the other side of that relationship, I really hoping that I can inspire my students with that same feeling of awe at building something from scratch and having it come to life. That's the feeling that lets me know I wouldn't want to be in any other career.
