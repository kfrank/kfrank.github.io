## A Little Solo Travel

My mom sent me an email a few days after I booked a flight to Barcelona. Sure, it was my first time traveling entirely by myself to Europe, but I would only be gone for five days (super short trip in the scheme of things), I had been to Europe more times than I could count on two hands, and gotten back home from an entirely different city than where my flight was taking off a year prior. So when I woke up one morning with an email in my inbox telling me that she wished I didn't go off by myself (I received a similar email from my grandmother as well), I wrote it off as motherly worry.

Confidence is a strange muscle. When you have it, everything seems to fall right off your shoulders like emerging from underneath a waterfall mostly dry.
