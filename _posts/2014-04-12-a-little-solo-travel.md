## A Little Solo Travel

My mom sent me an email a few days after I booked a flight to Barcelona. Sure, it was my first time traveling  by myself to Europe, but I would only be gone for five days (a super short trip in the scheme of things). I had been to Europe more times than I could count on two hands, and traveled home from a completely different city than where my flight leaving only a year prior. So when I woke up one morning with an email in my inbox telling me that she wished I didn't go off by myself (I received a similar email from my grandmother as well), I wrote it off as motherly worry. And it was. Mostly.

>Confidence is a strange muscle. When you have it, everything is as easy as a fork gliding through a slice of cheesecake. It's a pretty damn sweet feeling. 

All my life, whenever I'd have to go someplace new or do something I'd never done before, I'd have to force myself. That funny, sick feeling in my gut would emerge and I'd be so nervous that I'd be planning my escape route in all possible situations. I spent most of my life being afraid of new situations and thinking I was an introvert. It took losing all my confidence completely and having a year of rebuilding to discover that I wasn't. I'm just a reserved extrovert. With a lot of long pauses.

The best part about traveling solo is that you don't have to wait for anyone to make your plans. Hell, you don't even have to make plans. I still remember how upset my mother got in Prague when my father and I just decided to go sit outside at lunch for a few hours having beers instead of doing the things she had planned. So we sat for a while, enjoying the August weather, becoming fishes in our liters of beer with smug grins creeping across our faces because we only paid 30 koruna for everything. Different people have different traveling styles. Some people like to sit soak up the ambiance of a new place. Some people simply like to see the sights. Some enjoy having their itinerary mapped out entirely beforehand.

The second best part about traveling is that you get to strike up a conversation with anyone. I understand now why they call it striking up a conversation. Out of nothing, you strike a match and that flame that had not existed before is suddenly bright and dancing, and for a brief point in time, it's possible to light up anything or extinguish the flame in an instant. Far too often, we rely on happenstance to meet someone new instead of actively creating these moments. Once I grew my confidence, I started to look forward to these moments I could make happen. One of my best conversations was when I met a professor from Drexel at a coffee shop and started talking to him about the quirks of different cities and how it's hard to find new and interesting coffee.

My only regret from the trip was that it was too short. Thankfully, I've already booked another flight, this time to Seattle, since I haven't been able to get the emerald city out of my head for a year and a half.

Let's go!
