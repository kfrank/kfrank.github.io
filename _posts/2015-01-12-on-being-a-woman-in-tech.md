When my mother graduated college and was working in her first job as a computer programmer, women made up 35% of all technology jobs. Not that great, right?

Today it’s only 15%.

Let me get that straight. In 25 years, the technology industry has seen growth in just about all areas except one: being able to attract and keep women in technology jobs. That means my mother was more likely to work with a greater percentage of women when she started her career than I am now.

Just last year, ___ proved diversity increases collaboration and creativity on teams, and boosts productivity. It’s undoubtedly what companies should be looking for instead of hiring from the same pool of applicants they’ve found in the same places over and over again. Many companies have already recognized this and starting making changes. Props.

Hell, NYTimes recently published an article stating that teams with more women outperformed others.

Yet, it’s not just about hiring or creating a great workplace environment. It’s a good step, but it’s not enough. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, we should strive to build an inclusive community.

I’d like to say that articles like this or this or this or even this aren’t commonplace, but they are. They only represent a sliver of the encounters women have had being discriminated for.

I’d like to say I haven’t been harassed as a woman in tech or that I’ve never had to wonder if me being chosen for something (a job, a speaking engagement, etc.) wasn’t simple because of my gender. But I can’t. And I know it’s the same for every woman in a technical field.
