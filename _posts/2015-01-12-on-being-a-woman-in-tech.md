When my mother graduated college and was working in her first job as a computer programmer, women made up 35% of all technology jobs. Not that great, right?

Today it’s only 15%.

Let me get that straight. In 25 years, the technology industry has seen growth in just about all areas except one: being able to attract and keep women in technology jobs. That means my mother was more likely to work with a greater percentage of women when she started her career than I am now.

Just last year, ___ proved diversity increases collaboration and creativity on teams, and boosts productivity. It’s undoubtedly what companies should be looking for instead of hiring from the same pool of applicants they’ve found in the same places over and over again. Many companies have already recognized this and starting making changes. Props.

Hell, NYTimes recently published an article stating that teams with more women outperformed others.

Yet, it’s not just about hiring or creating a great workplace environment. It’s a good step, but it’s not enough. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, we should strive to build an inclusive community.

I’d like to say that articles like this or this or this or even this aren’t commonplace, but they are. They only represent a sliver of the encounters women have had being discriminated for.

I’d like to say I haven’t been harassed as a woman in tech or that I’ve never had to wonder if me being chosen for something (a job, a speaking engagement, etc.) wasn’t simple because of my gender. But I can’t. And I know it’s the same for every woman in a technical field.


“Men are almost three times as likely to interrupt women as they are to interrupt other men.”

Enduring influence of stereotypical...

“Feeling a sense of belonging in an academic field is a powerful predictor of subsequent interest in that field”

“When women were exposed to a stereotypical computer science role model, they reported lower expected success in computer science immediately after the encounter compared to those who encountered no role model or a nonstereotypical computer science role model, regardless of whether the role model was a woman or a man.”

“In the case of computer science, there is no longer a gender gap in quantitative ability on standardized tests prior to entering college yet, women compose less than 15% of first-year undergraduates intending to major in computer science”

“The current prevalence of representations of scientists and engineers who fit current stereotypes in American media may be preventing more women from entering the field of computer science.”

STEM Education - preparing

“Only 14 percent of engineers are women, as are just 27 percent of individuals working in computer science and math positions.”

“Computer science departments grant more undergraduate degrees than mathematics and the physical sciences combined and thus have the potential to attract many more women into STEM fields.”

Hostile sexism punishes women when they challenge male dominance, while benevolent sexism rewards women for conforming to stereotypes and roles that serve men’s needs. Together, these ideologies act as the carrot and the stick that motivate women to stay “in their place.”

Benevolent sexist items idealize women as wonderful (e.g., “Many women have a quality of purity that few men possess”), to be cherished (e.g., “A good woman ought to be set on a pedestal by her man”), but as dependent on male providers (e.g., “Men should be willing to sacrifice their own well-being in order to provide financially for the women in their lives”).

Men who scored high in BS assigned less challenging opportunities to female (but not male) subordinates. Low BS men did not show this effect, nor did women, regardless of their BS scores.

In short, converging evidence suggests that benevolently sexist discrimination sabotages women from the outside -- shunting them to a slower track by limiting opportunities – and from the inside – by sowing self-doubt.

brogrammer culture

Women in tech industry have to not only endure gendered insults or sexist jokes from male colleagues they often have to pretend to not take notice, or take any offense, and to laugh them off as funny so as to be one of the “guys”.

Clinton notes that women receive only 18 percent of computer science degrees — less than half of what it was in the 1980s, when women earned 38 percent of those degrees.

“We’re going backwards in a field that is supposed to be all about moving forward,” Clinton said.
