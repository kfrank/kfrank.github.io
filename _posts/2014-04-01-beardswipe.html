<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Our phones aren&#39;t secure enough. Anyone can take our fingerprints to hack their way in, and now that the technology has been out for at least six months, it&#39;s getting a bit stale.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-built">What We Built</h2>
<p>Beardswipe, the greatest invention since beards made men. Beards are the newest key to unlocking our phones. BeardSwipe utilizes a patented beardprint recognition technology—BRT—to capture a man&#39;s unique follicle pattern and lets you effortlessly unlock your phone. Where will we go from here? Literally no one knows.</p>

<p>Our self-selected team at iStrategyLabs came together to create an April Fools prank that highlighted our talents for building physical technology products. We filmed a short video and created a product landing page with two iphone screens as a prototype for our (fake) product.</p>

<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
<p>Knowing that I&#39;d be both designing and deving the website, I started off with a simple wireframe of the one page site. This helped me explain my ideas for what I&#39;d develop later to my coworkers and also allowed them to create some excellent content for the areas I had set up.</p>

<p>I set up the page initially in basic html and started laying out the typography on the page. Since this was an April Fools prank targeted towards the tech community as a product, I decided on the trendy and overused Brandon Grotesque with a little bit of Apple&#39;s standard iOS font, Helvetica Neue.</p>
<p>I also really wanted to bring in some of the urban woodseyness from our target demographic with the background header image and round out the page with a little bit of gold from the newest iPhone 5s.</p>

<p>We were originally going to take a set of lookbook photographs that would capture the essence of our demographic, so I tried to keep in mind that we&#39;d have huge, crisp pictures of bearded men. But we scraped that because of time, so I was stuck using images of our coworkers. Lame. Some of them can&#39;t even grow beards.</p>

<p>It was a basic build, using sass with bourbon and a little bit of jquery. The most difficult thing was figuring out how to get the vimeo api to autoplay and stop the video based on the users&#39; interaction with the modal, but I nailed that right before I had to hop a flight to Barcelona.</p>
