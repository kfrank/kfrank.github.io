<p>I don’t make resolutions. Ever since sixth grade when we had to write our new years resolutions on sheets of colored construction paper to hang up in the hallway, I’ve always thought of them as an opportunity for disappointment. I think I came up with something vague like ‘be better’. Seriously. I was kinda a hipster kid who hated boy bands and thought being like everyone else was the worst thing ever.</p>

<p>I still have never made a new years resolution. Sure, I’ve had goals and dreams, but I’ve always tried never to put a definite time on them and assume that the right time will come around. If it doesn’t, I’ll probably be too annoyed with myself and make it happen.</p>

<p>This year I decided to choose something every month to focus on. Once that month was done, I’d either have forgotten what I was doing or evaluate, pick a new goal, and move on.</p>

<p>Here’s a few of the things I focused on in 2014:</p>

<h2 id="be_an_active_listener">Be an active listener</h2>

<p>Sometimes I have this simultaneous conversation in my head every time I meet someone for the first time. It usually goes like: What am I going to say next? What can I come up with to make them think I’m interesting. Avoid awkward pauses. Cmon. Aww shit. You just forgot their name.</p>

<p>Icebreakers are fine when you first meet someone, but the best conversations just happen naturally out of mentioning the randomest things. To do that, you have to actually listen to the conversation and not try to act some play or figure our what’s next. It’ll come naturally if you’re paying attention and are actually interested. If not, count it as an off day and move on.</p>

<h2 id="spend_time_away_from_a_screen">Spend time away from a screen</h2>

<p>I gave up Netflix in 2014, save for a brief two days in February obviously reserved for a House of Cards marathon, which forced me to read books for entertainment whenever I was home. I was rarely ever home, but I did manage to finish a good dozen of books this year. I also realized that tv shows come up a LOT in normal conversation, which most of the time made me feel like a strange time traveler with a blank look on my face. I also brewed more beers this year than last and spent more time on a plane than probably in the past five years.</p>

<h2 id="stress_less">Stress less</h2>

<p>I know when I’m stressed out because I wake up with an aching jaw or find myself clenching my teeth in the middle of the day. Which I didn’t really think was that big a problem until my dentist told me I had partially fractured a molar. Seriously. Stress is bad for your health. Find ways to get past it, whether it’s removing yourself from a situation, talking it out, or meditating.</p>

<h2 id="make_exercise_a_habit">Make exercise a habit</h2>

<p>Growing up, I never ran under a ten minute mile. Despite not being overweight, I always dreaded gym class. I think it’s one of those things where you try something once and think you’re not good at it so you decide you’re not athletic (or artistic) and have a self-assigned label plastered on you all your life. But kids are rarely told you can still be great at something even if you suck the first time. So I stuck to individual sports, like biking.</p>

<p>In my adult life, I’ve never really had that much luck making it a habit, but after working at a desk for years and having to deal with some moderate scoliosis, I really wanted to build up better posture (or as better as I can).</p>

<h2 id="drink_less_alcohol_drink_more_water">Drink less alcohol, drink more water</h2>

<p>This was a tough one, since DC is very much a social drinking city and I made Monday night happy hours a thing. Also since I brew beer. But, damn, there’s only so much drinking a person can do in one day before they decide it’s time to just grow up. Bye bye all day epic brunches. It’s for the best.</p>

<h2 id="go_your_own_way">Go your own way</h2>

<p>This year I made my first solo trip to Europe. Barcelona, specifically. It’s a great way to build confidence, especially in a city where I didn’t know either of the languages. (I studied German in high school and college, not Spanish like most people in America.) There’s things I used to get shy about, like talking to strangers or going out to eat by myself. On a solo trip, you have to get over those fears pretty quickly otherwise you’re going to be hungry and miss out on meeting some great people.</p>

<p>Now if I need to do something I’ve never done before, I assume since I could navigate a foreign city and make it back home in one piece, it won’t be too bad. I recently booked my second solo trip for a longer duration.</p>

<h2 id="work_on_something_that_matters">Work on something that matters</h2>

<p>I mostly decided to become a Developer in Residence at General Assembly this year because I had always been interested in education and mentoring. After seeing a good friend go from learning almost no html and css to getting a second job as a frontend dev in two years, I realized there’s nothing more amazing than that first aha moment someone has when learning how to be a developer. This year, it’s most all of my work as been about education or providing opportunities, especially since I switched jobs to join the team at Treehouse. I’m really grateful that I never have to question the morality of what I create.</p>

<p>It’s been a great year and I’ve learned a hell of a lot about myself. Honestly, I’m probably the most confident I’ve been in years and can’t wait to show all of you want I’m working on and planning for next year.</p>

<p>Thanks &amp; Happy New Year.</p>
