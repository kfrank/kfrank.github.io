<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>Earning a living as a professional tennis coach can be difficult at times because of the complexities of scheduling between coach, player, and court. </p>

<p>CourtPlay is an effort to make booking a tennis lesson effortless. A coach can manage their schedule, message players and receive payments via the web app. A player can search for coaches in their area, book lessons directly with them and pay them online.</p>


<h2>User Experience</h2>
<p>One of the biggest challenges was creating an interface that was simple enough for both coaches and players. This was especially challenging when we adding calendar bookings and payment of lessons through the dashboard.</p>
