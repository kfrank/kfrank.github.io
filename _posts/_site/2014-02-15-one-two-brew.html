<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>One Two Brew is a side project I started developing about six months after I first started homebrewing. I quickly found the barrier to entry in the hobby was uniquely high, but I enjoyed the level of complexity found in the math and science of homebrewing.</p> 

<p>What I found to be lacking was a good way of tracking brews and being reminded of benchmarks in the brewing process. There were already a few tools existing that helped with robust recipe creation, but none of them went a step further and gave the brewer unique timers associated with their recipes. From the very beginning, I decided this would be a phone app, since going back to look at a computer was simply not as convenient when brewing as pulling out a phone with one hand.</p>

<h2>What I Worked On</h2>

<h3>Userflows</h3>
<p>Since I knew this was going to be a complex app, I decided to break the user flow into two parts: recipe creation, and brewing timers.</p>

<h3>Wireframes</h3>
<p>I went through several iterations of wireframes trying to find the best ways of showing time elapses and user inputed data for recipes. What I arrived on was a vertical timer (instead of a circular one) and a radar graph for viewing and editing recipe stats.</p>
