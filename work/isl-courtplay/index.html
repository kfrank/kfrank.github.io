            <p class="m-t-2-xs">Courtplay was a web application that gives coaches the ability to market themselves, eases the administrative responsibilities of coaching, eliminates the inefficiencies of their current scheduling process, and gives them maximum earning potential. Players now have all the necessary tools to sign up for lessons, find players at their skill level, and locate courts in their neighborhood.</p>
            <p>Earning a living as a professional tennis coach can be difficult at times because of the complexities of scheduling between coach, player, and court. Courtplay is an effort to make booking a tennis lesson effortless. A coach can manage their schedule, message players and receive payments via the web app. A player can search for coaches in their area, book lessons directly with them and pay them online.</p>

            <h3 class="text-5-xs text-4-lg m-t-3-xs bold">1. User experience</h3>
            <p class="m-t-1-xs">One of the biggest challenges was creating an interface that was simple enough for both coaches and players. This was especially challenging when we adding calendar bookings and payment of lessons through the dashboard.</p>
            <p>I took over this project when it was partway through ideation. Very minimal user flow and screens were thought out prior to this, so a lot of user experience deliverables were required to build the product correctly from the ground up.</p>

            <p class="m-t-1-xs">A large component of this website involved designing a custom icon set that was specific to tennis coaches and players. These were adapted from the color palette to reflect actual sports colors used.</p>
            <div class="col-50-md col-center">
              <img src="icons.jpg" alt="" class="w-fit-xs">
            </div>
            <p>This app went through a few iterations to add features, including the calendar and messenging feature. It needed to be more robust than what was initially designed. To create a sustainable design environment, I built the css using atomic design patterns. This allowed me to direct other developers how to design for new features as we were testing.</p>
