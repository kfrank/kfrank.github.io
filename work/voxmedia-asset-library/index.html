            <h1 class="text-3-xs text-2-lg m-t-3-xs bold">Creating a Dropbox-linked automatically generated asset library</h1>
            <p class="m-t-2-xs">Our marketing design team gets requests for logos and assets relating to networks and brands on a constant basis. Colleagues spend a significant time asking and waiting for assets to be hunted down which slows down their work process. We needed centralized place where that colleagues and press can download assets they needed to get back to their tasks without waiting.</p>
            <p>Our audience included designers who need to control, curate, and update folders of logos, colors, and relevant style guide assets, employees who need to view and download needed assets, and outside media and press who also need to view and download assets, but may be presented an abbreviated version of the asset library.</p>
            <h2 class="text-4-xs text-3-lg m-t-3-xs bold">Proposed Solution</h2>
            <p class="m-t-2-xs">Use Dropbox or Google Drive APIs to display stored assets in folders divided by network and type on a style guide page or site. If assets need to be updated, a designer can replace logos in the Dropbox or Google Drive main style guide folder. If new networks or brands are added, folders can be added to the Dropbox or Google Drive main style guide folder, which will be updated automatically via the API on the style guide page or site.
            </p>
            <p>Logo assets rarely get updated but when they do it's paramount everyone is using the new versions. This solution was chosen as a way for designers to quickly update files when needed without having to remember where to go (i.e., an externally managed style guide site).</p>
            <h2 class="text-4-xs text-3-lg m-t-3-xs bold">Process</h2>
            <h3 class="text-5-xs text-4-lg m-t-3-xs bold">1. Research &amp; Proposal</h3>
            <p class="m-t-1-xs">Since this was a project which did not directly bring in money or relate to our company-wide business focus (video), I had to present justification for this project by creating an initial creative brief including an estimated timeline. Creating an asset library would take strain off designers workflows, freeing them up to complete larger projects, and allow the company to better control overall brand projection by managing which logos and assets get used company-wide and externally. This project was pitched first to my design directors and we all agreed I should move forward with a prototype to show how this system might work.</p>
            <h3 class="text-5-xs text-4-lg m-t-3-xs bold">2. Design &amp; Prototype</h3>
            <p class="m-t-1-xs">Unlike other projects, I started with developing the prototype first before design to judge the project's feasiblity and worked design in around the API calls.</p>
            <h3 class="text-5-xs text-4-lg m-t-3-xs bold">3. Iteration</h3>
