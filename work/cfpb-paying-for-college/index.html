            <p class="m-t-2-xs">Paying for College is tool to help prospective college students and their families decipher how much a college degree actually costs. The cost comparison worksheet computes the actual cost of the chosen schools by comparing tuition, books, and other expenses, estimated post-school debt and overall debt burden. </p>
            <p>Student debt can be a confusing arena where it's often difficult to understand how to compare the financial benefits of getting a college degree. Getting a college degree is often a part of the American dream, but students and parents taking on this debt often fail to realize the debt burden after school. This tool aims to help 21 million prospective college students and their high school counselors.</p>
            <p>As a part of the product team at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB, I prototyped my designs in code and worked with other ux designers in sprint cycles to release Paying for College, a set of tools catered towards the education life milestone.</p>

            <h3 class="text-5-xs text-4-lg m-t-3-xs bold">1. User experience</h3>
            <p class="m-t-1-xs">Brittany Mederos and I collaborated on how to build this tool, whiteboarding out different scenarios that we'd both elaborate on and test. We ran into issues of how users were going to input data (if at all), how we would integrate two-year and four-year programs, and how to easily compare costs of different programs. This stemmed from working inter-agency with the Department of Education. </p>
            <p>After conducting usability tests to reveal the previous comparision tool was unusable, we decided to redesign with a new layout which would include school indicators so students could compare more effectively, and a GI Bill calculator to calculate eligible benefits. We decided to move forward with a prototype to enable better user testing of the tool.</p>

            <h3 class="text-5-xs text-4-lg m-t-3-xs bold">2. Design &amp; Prototyping</h3>
            <p class="m-t-1-xs">Paying for College was meant to be an extension of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau brand. It drew inspiration from light usage of color on the rest of the website while focusing primarily on interactions. One of the more interesting parts of the interface was the sticky input header that allowed users to easily switch between schools, and the sticky footer containing important debt information that would attach itself to the bottom of the page once the user reached far enough down the cost table.</p>
