            <h1 class="text-3-xs text-2-lg m-t-3-xs bold">Ideating a microsite content management solution for marketing and events</h1>
            <p class="m-t-2-xs">Marketing, events, and conferences have requested several one or few page websites to showcase content and drive rsvps for events and getting in contact for advertising purposes. Some examples of microsites I’ve been tasked with designing and developing at Vox Media include: <a href="http://voxmedia.com/newfronts">Vox Media Video (Newfronts 2017)</a>, <a href="https://www.voxmedia.com/pages/2016-year-in-review-vox-media">2016 Year in Review</a>, and <a href="http://concert.io">Concert</a>.</p>
            <p>Chorus, Vox Media’s editorial CMS, allows for content editing, page creation, and management without coding knowledge, but is restricting, limiting designs to basic pages with only CSS changes on the overall layout. This creates a great deal of design and development debt placed on front-end designers and is not sustainable as more and more event microsites are requested.</p>
            <p>Our audience included copy editors, designers, program managers, directors, or anyone they designate who is responsible for image and copy updates to existing websites.</p>
            <h2 class="text-4-xs text-3-lg m-t-3-xs bold">Proposed Solution</h2>
            <p class="m-t-2-xs">A lightweight CMS which sits as a layer on top of the designed and developed initial build allowing content editing and publishing. This could integrate into Chorus’s platform by using it’s authentication and publishing capabilities.</p>
            <h2 class="text-4-xs text-3-lg m-t-3-xs bold">Process</h2>
            <h3 class="text-5-xs text-4-lg m-t-3-xs bold">1. Research &amp; Proposal</h3>
            <p class="m-t-1-xs">I proposed this project to my design directors as a way to reduce the amount of text and image updating required by front-end designers and developers. Over the past year, I've been researching possible solutions which could integrate into our existing editorial CMS. Currently, we have several different layouts for page types which can be created from the network index.</p>
            <p>We also have a feature called editorial apps, which allows custom pages to be hooked up to Chorus’ publishing features. I currently use this feature to create these sites. Editorial apps do have the ability to create a google spreadsheet to house page content, but these spreadsheets can be confusing to update and have bugs. They did not seem like a viable way for allowing the marketing team to update microsites, but could be a stepping stone to allow for further iteration.</p>
            <p>To petition the product team to include a lightweight CMS in their roadmap, I wrote up a proposal which included a mock timeline for several concept solutions. Included in this proposal were the results of several user interviews with front-end designers and marketing staff usually tasked with updating pages.</p>
            <h3 class="text-5-xs text-4-lg m-t-3-xs bold">2. Design &amp; Prototype</h3>
            <p class="m-t-1-xs">In the brief, I also included sketches and mockups of the several concept solutions. One of these solutions creates two panels on the top and bottom of the page as to not interfer with the design and allow for responsive editing while allowing editors to click into elements to edit text and replace images.</p>
            <p>Feature list:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Replace, add, and remove photos</li>
              <li>Edit text and headings</li>
              <li>Provide recommended word count for text and headings</li>
              <li>Allow predefined sections to be added to certain areas </li>
              <li>Reorder and delete sections and parts of sections</li>
              <li>Save as a draft and send for review with a unique link</li>
              <li>Publish page</li>
              <li>Cancel editing</li>
              <li>Authenticate appropriate users</li>
              <li>Integrate RSVP, Sweepstakes, and Content capture forms</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="m-t-1-xs">The wireframes for this solution demonstrate in-browser editing functionality. All publishing icons appear in the top bar while the bottom panel reveals pre-defined sections which can be dragged into allowed parts of the layout. The parts could be definited with data attributes in the code.</p>
